# Changelog

## 1.0.0 (2025-06-05)

#### Features

* **structure:** initial implementation of OpenXR camera rig ([f915e96](https://github.com/ExtendRealityLtd/Tilia.CameraRigs.OpenXR.Unity/commit/f915e965058ec492cb3ec793a97c48bc56c50026))
  > The OpenXR camera rig provides a prefab that should work with any supported OpenXR vendor plugin. It needs unity to be configured for each vendor plugin and there are samples with the package to provide access to OpenXR extensions. At the moment the only extension supported is Passthrough on a basic level.
  > 
  > The package also contains an editor helper to allow quick switching between OpenXR profile settings in Unity as it would seem Unity does not offer this functionality, and even in Unity 6 with Build Profiles it does not seem supported.
